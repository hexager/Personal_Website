I decided to add an update to the blog.
## What I've accomplished

It was a total website overhaul as compared to the time I made my last post. I was sticking to the bullet point system.

1. **Overall major upgrade to aesthetics**: Made a far better-looking website, instead of the default HTML font and black text on a white background, I made it far cleaner with a font which better fits my aesthetic, and also added view transitions which feel better than abrupt cuts.

2. **Implemented Tag system**: Added a tag system, which will allow easier navigation through my website once it is populated with more blog posts.

3. **Refactored the website**: Created a basic website layout as well as a basic blog post layout, which will allow me to not repeat code across multiple sites.

## What's Next

As for the basic template for the website, except for switching and improving the colours, I will leave it as is. Now is the time for me to focus more on other disciplines, however, I would love to come back and tweak the site more in the future.

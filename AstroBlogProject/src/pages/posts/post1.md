Hello, this is the first of many blogs I am going to be writing to document my CS journey. I plan to update this semi-regularly with new posts, both to build out this website as well as to keep myself accountable into not being too lazy. It will take me a while to get a proper schedule down though.


## What I've accomplished

Well, this! I wanted to start my project journey by creating the project which will host all projects. After a search for resources. I landed on Astro to build my website. As for hosting, I am currently using Netlify, I do plan to changing to Cloudflare maybe, if I can acquire a nice domain. 
Keeping my accomplishments to a bullet point system:

1. **Installing Astro and Setting it up**: This was quite easy, I initially installed a template, but then decided otherwise and started fresh. Setting it up was quite easy, only minor issues cropped up, all of which were fixed in under 3 minutes.

2. **Making Pages**: Such as the home page, about page, and the blog page, I learnt how to leverage Astro to make a functioning website with webpages.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: Writing this in markdown, I need to get a hang of this to make my posts look better. You will probably see my posts improve as I get more comfortable with Astro and with Markdown, well Hopefully atleast.

4. **Hosting on Netlify**: Another quite streamlined process. Minor humps which were smoothed out without issue. 

## What's next

Following the Astro Tutorial through the Docs, will add more components to my website and then, beautify it. Currently my website sure is a website, just a really ugly one.
After that, maybe I will settle into my college schedule, will try to form a schedule for this after that, but that's ways away, let's take things a step at a time.

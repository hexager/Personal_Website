## What I've accomplished
I have added a nice and smooth transition betweeen light and dark mode, this transition mode also effect the components on screen.
I have also added major improvements to the color scheme, both for light and especially for dark mode.

## What I've learnt
That refactoring code is time-consuming, very. However, getting the final product out is just as satisfying. I made sure to keep all my style settings in one consolidated file, I should have done that before, It makes editing color schemes and making general aesthetic changes far easier.

## What's Next
I have been working quite a bit on the AI side of my studies, expect the next post to be quite long as it will be a big update on what I have been doing on that front.
After that, I am planning to beautify the website even more. Currently I like how my website functions and works but I do still feel it lacks a bit of oomph in the presentation side of things. Need time to gather Ideas for that.

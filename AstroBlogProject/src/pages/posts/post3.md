## Where I have been
I know, that it has been 20 days since I last added a blog post but there's a reason for that. I was busy moving in and settling into college. It's been a ride and im sure I am not fully settledd in yet but atleast now I have the time to give this blog an Update/

## What I will be doing now
Well, now that I am here, I am going to explore the interests I have and keep this website updated with my new learnings as well as projects.
Short Blog but thats all that there's to say, will update more consistently and with more significant changes from now on.
